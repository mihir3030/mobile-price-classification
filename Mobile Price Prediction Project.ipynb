    ">__MOBILE PRICE PREDICTION :__ In this Project,on the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc we are deciding which of them have more impact on price. About this Dataset Context Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc. He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem. In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is. \n",
